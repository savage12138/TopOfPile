# TopOfPile
This project explores a programming problem that arises in many different robotics applications. In a manufacturing setting, a robotic arm may need to pick up parts from a pile and use them to assemble something such as an automobile. To plan the robotic armâ€™s movements, an overhead camera may be positioned over a pile of parts. In this project, we will focus on determining which color part is on top of the pile. (This may be important in finding a particular component and uncovering it so it can be used.) We would like this task to be performed in real-time, so the computational and storage requirements must be kept to a minimum. We are also concerned with the functional correctness of the algorithms used (i.e., getting the correct answer), since picking the wrong top part could lead to extra work for the robot or worse a malfunction if the pieces get tangled.
